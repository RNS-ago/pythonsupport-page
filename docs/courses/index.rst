DTU Courses
===========

.. note::

   Courses may have their own guides on how to install, we encourage
   students to primarily refer to these resources.
   The documentation here is considered complimentary to the course
   material, unless otherwise stated by the teacher.

.. tip::

   If an error is encountered during the installation process, it is *vital*
   to report this to :email:`pythonsupport@dtu.dk` so we can correct/add
   content for work-arounds.

   Thanks!

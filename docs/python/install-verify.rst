Verifying installation
======================

To verify if Python is installed correctly follow the steps below:  

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: {{ windows }}
      :sync: win

      #. Give your keyboard's window key a friendly nudge.  
      #. Type ``powershell`` in the search bar, and hit enter to launch PowerShell.
      #. In the powershell window, type ``python --version``
      #. If you spot the ``Python x.xx.x`` smiling back at you, you're all set! You've got a Python in your machine |:snake:|.  

   .. tab-item:: {{ macos }}
      :sync: mac

      #. Give your keyboard's ``Command`` key a friendly nudge.
      #. Type ``terminal`` in the search bar, and press Enter to open Terminal.
      #. In the Terminal window, type ``python3 --version``
      #. If you see the ``Python x.xx.x`` smiling back at you, you're all set! You've got a Python friend on your machine |:snake:|.

   .. tab-item:: {{ linux}}
      :sync: linux

      #. Open a terminal
      #. In the Terminal window, type ``python3 --version``

3. I want to get out of here (cd)
==================================

To navigate to a different directory, you can use the ``cd`` command followed by the path to the desired directory. For example, to move to a directory named "my_folder," you can use:

.. code:: termynal

   $ cd my_folder

**Exercise:** Change to a different directory using the ``cd`` command.

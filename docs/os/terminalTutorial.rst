.. Learning the Basics of the Terminal



4. General Navigation Tips
==========================

Here are some helpful tips for efficient navigation:

- Use the ``Tab`` key to autocomplete file, folder, or package names.
- Use the arrow keys (up and down) to navigate through previously executed commands.

5. How can I create a new folder? (mkdir)
==========================================

To create a new directory (folder), use the ``mkdir`` command followed by the desired folder name:

.. code:: 

   $ mkdir my_new_folder

**Exercise:** Create a new folder using the ``mkdir`` command.

6. Which Python Version? (python/python3)
==========================================

To check your Python version, you can use either ``python`` or ``python3`` command:

.. code:: 

   $ python --version

OR

.. code:: 

   $ python3 --version

**Exercise:** Check the Python version installed on your system.

7. Python Interactive Shell and Normal Terminal Shell
=====================================================

To enter the Python interactive shell, simply type ``python`` or ``python3`` and press Enter. You will see a different prompt, indicating that you are now in the Python shell.

To exit the Python shell, you can type ``exit()`` or press ``Ctrl + D`` (Unix-based systems) or ``Ctrl + Z`` followed by ``Enter`` (Windows).

**Exercise:** Enter and exit the Python interactive shell to differentiate it from the normal terminal shell.

8. What Packages Do I Have in Python? (pip list)

To list the installed Python packages, you can use the ``pip list`` command:

.. code:: 

   $ pip list

**Exercise:** List the Python packages installed on your system.

9. Installing and Uninstalling Packages Using pip
=================================================

To install a Python package using ``pip``, use the ``pip install`` command followed by the package name:

.. code:: 

   $ pip install package_name

To uninstall a package, use ``pip uninstall``:

.. code:: 

   $ pip uninstall package_name

**Exercise:** Install and uninstall a Python package using ``pip``.
